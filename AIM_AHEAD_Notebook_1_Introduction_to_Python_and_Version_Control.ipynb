Most AI projects also involve several distinct phases of coding (e.g. data extraction, data processing, ML modeling, visualizations) that cannot be completed by a single person. Thus, it is paramount to ensure the interoperability and seamless integration between various components and modules of an often large-scale AI system that may be changing often based on experimental feedback. `Git` (and version control in general) is critical for collaborative development of a medical AI project.\n",

You can use branches to have different versions of a project at one time. This is helpful when you want to add new features to a project without changing the main source of code. The work done on different branches will not show up on the main branch until you merge it, which we will cover later in this guide. You can use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to `main`.\n",
