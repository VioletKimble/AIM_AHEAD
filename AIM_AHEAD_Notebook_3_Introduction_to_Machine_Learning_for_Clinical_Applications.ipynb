        "* Relevant data must be extracted (example: all revelant laboratory values and vital signs).\n",
        "* Data quality and conformation to modeling requirements must be ensured through data preprocessing (example: fixing the missing data, removing any unwanted outliers, and encoding the categorical data.)\n",
        "  \n",
        "#### 🏗️ Model development\n",
        "* Machine learning models are built from data.\n",
        "* Recall our module on functions: an ML model can be thought of as a **function** that maps a set of input values (example: patient characteristics) to an output value (example: probability of developing AKI).\n",
        "* We develop a model on data from a **training** cohort.\n",
        "* During the model refinement stage, known as **training**, model parameters (such as *weights* and *biases*) are altered to optimize the associations between inputs and outputs.\n",
        "* After training, a model is ready to make predictions on *new data it has not seen before*. But how accurate will it be?\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 🔎 Evaluation and Intepretation\n",
        "* Once a ML model is trained, we evaluate the end result on **testing** dataset to see how well the model performed or how reliable it is.\n",
        "* Multiple performance metrics such as accuracy, AUC, sensitivity, and specificity can be evaluated.\n",
        "* Once we are satisfied with a model's performance, we may implement **explainable AI (XAI)** techniques to discover **why** a model behaves in a particular way.\n",
        "* XAI techniques include computing a relative importance score associated with each input feature/column (for a given patient, how important was each input in determining that patient's prediction?).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 📦 Deployment\n",
        "* ML model deployment is the process of placing a finished ML model into a live environment, such as creating a web service or mobile application for prediction.\n",
        "* It is imperative that the performance of an established model is continually monitored in prospective deployment to safeguard against data distribution shifts resulting from changes in populations, practice, or other changes that may result in deteriorating model performance over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### ⚡ Optimization\n",
        "* A deployed ML model has real-world impact and must be continuously monitored and maintained.\n",
        "* When new or updated data becomes available, or when we determine that an existing deployed model no longer results in satisfactory performance, we need to optimize the model by re-training and re-evaluating the ML model.\n",

        "In this tutorial, we will use a real-world dataset of 1,841 patients who underwent 2,174 total inpatient hospitalizations across 186 different hospitals spread throughout the United States. This is a subset of the [eICU Collaborative Research Database](https://eicu-crd.mit.edu/), a publicly available database which contains over 200,000 patient stays.\n",

        "\n",
        "* **29 model inputs, a.k.a. features (X)**. These are the patient characteristics that we'll pass into the model in order to predict the outcome.\n",
        "    * Demographic variables (e.g., `age`, `gender`, `ethnicity`)\n",
        "    * Admission information (e.g., admission_weight, admission source)\n",
        "    * Hospital information (e.g., geographic location, number of beds, whether it's a teaching hospital)\n",
        "    * 18 laboratory test results taken during their hospitalization\n",
        "* **1 model output, a.k.a. target/outcome (Y)**. This variable is what the model will be trained to predict based on the inputs above.\n",
        "    * **In-hospital mortality**, i.e., whether the patient died in the hospital or was discharged successfully. This is a binary outcome which is recorded as either 0 (survival) or 1 (death) for each patient.\n",
        "    * This dataset contains other columns that could serve as interesting outcomes to predict (e.g., `discharge_location` or `weight_discharge`). However, we leave these as a supplemental exercise for learners, and in this notebook, we focus exclusively on predicting `in_hospital_mortality`.\n",
        "    \n",
        "The objective of this exercise is to develop a machine learning model to predict the risk of in-hospital mortality given the above set of routinely collected information.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **⚠️ Warning:** Once you determine your what you'd like your model to predict, it is important to identify any variables that may pose a risk of **data leakage**, or information being available to your model during training that would not typically be available when making predictions in the future, and exclude them from input features used to train the model.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> For example, if our goal is to predict `in_hospital_mortality`, we cannot include `discharge_location` as an input feature, since one of the possible values of `discharge_location` is `Death`. If we knew the patient's discharge location, we would already know if they survived, and a mortality-prediction model would serve no purpose. If we include such features in our training, we would see extremely good model performance, but those results would be completely misleading and not very useful.\n",

Some of these columns are unique random numeric identifiers (e.g., `patient_id`, `hospital_id`) with no discernible meaning or pattern. Training a model with these columns has the potential to reduce model performance.\n",

In other words, each **sample** (i.e., row in our dataset) corresponds to a different hospital encounter, not a unique patient (notice above there are multiple rows for the same `patient_id`).\n",

        "\n",
        "Before we use our data to train a machine learning model, we must transform the raw data into **features** that an ML model can understand (sometimes these look quite similar, but not always). This critical step is called **data preprocessing**. Since real-world data can be messy, during this phase we also *clean* data to ensure the ML model can learn meaningful patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "Common data preprocessing steps may include the following (depending on the ML model used):\n",
        "* Removing outliers*.\n",
        "* Addressing data missingess.\n",
        "* Transforming binary string columns (e.g., sex) into a numerical form that the model can understand.\n",
        "* Transforming many-valued string columns (e.g., race) into a numerical form.\n",
        "* Normalizing input features to give them equal weighting.\n",
        "\n",
        "\\*One common approach to remove outliers in ML projects is to remove observations that fall outside a specified range. In this tutorial, we remove observations whose values are less than the 1st percentile or greater than the 99th percentile.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 🕳️ Addressing missing data\n",
        "\n",
        "* Missing data are common in routinely collected health data.\n",
        "    * Many times, missingness can be informative (e.g. a particular test was not ordered because patient was healthy).\n",
        "    * In other cases, missingness may be at random or due to other factors (e.g., lack of routine follow-up).\n",
        "* Some models **require** filling in missing data with imputation methods. Others will gladly accept missing data. The decision of when, and how to impute missing data, is often dependent on the model, data, and problem.\n",
        "* In a Pandas DataFrame, missing values will be represented by `NaN` (*\"Not a Number\"*).\n",
        "\n",
        "One simple, but effective, imputation approach is to replace a patient's missing variable value with a value computed from all other patients. For example, if a patient is missing the `height` variable, we might impute the mean value for the `height` feature across all other patients. Alternatively, we might simply drop this feature from the dataset. In practice, imputation decisions are highly context-specific, especially in healthcare, where sometimes missingness can be informative.\n",
        "\n",
        "For now, let's use code to replace any missing `height` values with the median `height` from all other patients. We can accomplish this using some pandas functions that we're already familiar with.\n",

This might make sense if we are dealing with an `ordinal variable` where the categories have a meaningful order. An example of an ordinal categorical variable might be a laboratory test whose results are given as `Very Low`, `Low`, `Normal`, `High`, or `Very High`. There is a clear ordering to these values that carries inherent meaning, so we could be justified in encoding our values as `0` (for `Very Low`), `1` (for `Low`), `2` (for `Normal`), `3` (for `High`), and `4` (for `Very High`).\n",

        "When working with multivariate data, many machine learning algorithms work best when each feature is represented on a similar scale.\n",
        "\n",
        "✈️ For example, suppose you are developing a ML model for predicting the total travel time of a commercial airliner.\n",
        "* Your model might use an `max_altitude` feature measured in feet, with typical values near `35,000`.\n",
        "* You might also have a `number_of_stops` feature, which might range from `0-3`.\n",
        "* Without adjusting for the scale difference between the two variables, many ML algorithms might inherently assign more importance (at least initially) to the variable with the larger values.\n",
        "* However, many times it is not simply the feature with the larger values that is more important. In this hypothetical example, the `number_of_stops` feature is likely to be more important for predicting total travel time.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Two common approaches to address this imbalance:\n",
        "* **Normalization:** Transform each numerical column's values into a `0-1` range.\n",
        "* **Standardization:** Transforming each numerical column's values to have a `mean = 0` and `standard deviation = 1`. (Note: Standardization will result in negative feature values.)\n",
        "* The optimal choice can be data and task-specific.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, we'll apply standardization.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **📌 Note:** In practice, transformations that require parameters from the data (for example, computing the mean and variance of a column is required for standardization), it is best practice to only use the **training set** to compute these values."

We've only discussed a few basic preprocessing approaches, but many more exist that are often data, model, and/or task-dependent.\n",
        "\n",
        "🕑 For now, let's save time with a heavy-handed approach that blindly one-hot encodes all categorical variables, replaces all missing values in each numerical column with the mean, and creates a new `missing` category for any missing categorical features.

        "2. **Loss (Error) Calculation:** The loss function calculates the network's total error, the difference between the model's predictions and the actual target values.\n",
        "3. **Backpropagation:** The gradients of the loss function with respect to the model's parameters are computed using the chain rule of calculus.\n",
        "4. **Parameter / Weight Update:**  The model's parameters are updated using optimization algorithms like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or its variants.\n",

There are several optional arguments we may also pass, which can be viewed in the [Keras documentation page](https://keras.io/api/layers/core_layers/dense/). We can add many layers to our deep learning model using the .add() function of the Sequential class. You can think of a Sequential container as a list of hidden layers.\n",

Our output layer will also be a Dense layer, but it will only have a single (1) unit. Instead of ReLU, we will use a sigmoid activation function, which is typically chosen for binary classification problems such as ours. Using a sigmoid activation on our output layer allows us to interpret the output as a prediction probability. In other words, the probability that a given input vector belongs to class 1.\n",
