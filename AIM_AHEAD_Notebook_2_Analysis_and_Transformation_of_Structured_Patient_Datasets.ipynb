This allows you to use your alias throughout your code, instead of the orignal module name. This is most often done for coding brevity, and aliases are often chosen to be succinct - two-letter aliases are common). However, in rare cases, aliasing can be necessary. For example, if you'd like to import two modules with the same name, you can assign one to an alias to avoid the overlap.\n",

        "> 📌 **Note:** The `temp_value` column contains temperature values that have been recorded using different units (specified in the `temp_unit` column): Fahrenheit, Celsius, or the `temp_unit` was missing for the given measurement. Since the below equation will be applied to **every** row, the equation assumes that every value in the `temp_value` column is already measured in `Fahrenheit` (an incorrect assumption). In practice, it is critical to have a firm grasp on the entire dataset before performing modifications, because just like this example, many times these are **logical errors** that do not generate any error messages. For now, we'll call the new column `temp_celsius_naive`."

        "Before diving into an AI project, taking the time to become intimately familiar with the data you will be modeling can save you time, energy, and headache later if things aren't turning out as you initially expected.  Exploratory data analysis can help you identify important data quality issues early in the AI process that can save you countless hours in the future.\n",

        "#### 🤔 Why is exploratory analysis so important for any data science project?\n",
        "* It can help identify major problems with the dataset that may challenge your assumptions and/or require returning to the data source or rethinking your entire question and/or approach.\n",
        "* You can quickly identify data quality issues such as missing values, outliers, and otherwise incomplete, irrelevant, or misaligned data elements.\n",
        "* A hands-on understanding of the data can influence your downstream selection of the best technical approach.\n",
        "* A better understanding of your population is likely to lead to a more accurate interpretation of your results.\n",
        "* Spending time early can help minimizing the amount of backtracking and repetition as issues are discovered later in pipeline.\n",
        "* Furthermore, for deployed systems that rely on continuous integration (CI), deployment (CD), and training (CT) on new data over time, continuous iterations of rigorous data analysis can help spot issues such as data drift (where models trained on older data become less relevant for newer data streams)\n",

        "Similar to how we performed basic arithmetic with built-in Python operators like `+` and `-`, Pandas offers many one-line functions that compute a variety of statistics about your DataFrame:\n",

        "\n",
        "☑️ Pandas provides multiple ways to select and process specific subsets (slices) of data based on flexible criteria.\n",
        "* One way to accomplish this is by using **boolean expressions** that evaluate to either `True` or `False`.\n",
        "* Boolean expressions often involve comparing values.\n",
        "* For example, `x > 4` is a boolean expression that evaluates to `True` when a variable `x` is greater than 4, and `False` when `x` is less than or equal to 4.\n",
        "* Another boolean expression might be `1 > 2`, which **always** evaluates to `False`.\n",
        "* If we let `C` refer to our boolean expression (i.e., our selection criteria), we can use it to select a subset of our DataFrame with the syntax `df[C]`.\n",
        "* Upon calling `df[C]`, the expression `C` will be evaluated for **every row** in the DataFrame, and only the rows where the expression evaluates to `True` will be returned in the result.\n",
        "* You can think of this process as filtering the data based on a search criteria.\n",
        "\n",
        "☑️ We can create selection criteria using familiar mathematical operators to compare values:\n",
        "* `>`: greater than\n",
        "* `<`: less than\n",
        "* `>=`: greater than or equal to\n",
        "* `<=`: less than or equal to\n",
        "* `!=`: is not equal to\n",
        "* `==`: is equal to a single value\n",
        "* **Bonus:** `.isin(L)`: is equal to any value contained in the list `L`.\n",
